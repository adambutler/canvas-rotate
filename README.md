# canvas-rotate

I found it hard to find a good resource on how to rotate a full non-square
canvas so I put together this demo to explain the process.

The initial canvas has markers on it which are useful for debugging and
give a clear idea of what is happening when you receive unexpected artifacts.

One day I may well wrap this up into a library.
